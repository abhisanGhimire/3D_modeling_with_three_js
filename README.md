# 3D Model demonstration with orbitloader

This is my first hands-on with 3D model rendering in a browser with THREE.js

## Usage

Download the project and load page in a browser with help of your local server

## Using XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP or similar stack 
Place all the files directly at the root of your server folder. 
Eg: 
place all files in htdocs for XAMPP without any folder creation

Or you can change the file path for import accordingly

## In VSCODE, open with live server

You can simply download and run with the live server using VS CODE Extensions
